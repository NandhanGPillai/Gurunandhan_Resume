## Projects

[Develop an Ovulation predictor Calculator using Python ](https://github.com/NandhanGPillai/Ovulation-Day-Prediction) 
---

* Created using Visual Studio Code for Python
* Motivation: Embarked on this project with the noble intention of aiding individuals who have encountered challenges in identifying their ovulation 
   day and simplifying their life planning.
* Utilized DateTime Module for date parsing and manipulation.
* Error Handling is implemented to ensure valid user inputs and provide informative error messages.
* The calculator prompts users to input the first date of their last menstrual period and the length of their menstrual cycle in days.
* Data validation method validates the provided date format and Data Calculation method estimates the Ovulation day.

[Hey Gurunandhan! What's the weather?](https://github.com/NandhanGPillai/Weather-App)
---

This Weather App is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) application that allows users to retrieve and display real-time weather information for a specified city. The project aims to provide a convenient way for users to access weather data, including temperature, wind speed, pressure, humidity, sunrise, sunset, cloudiness, and a weather description, for a city of their choice.
* The tkinter library is used to create the graphical user interface (GUI) for the application.
* The requests library is employed to make HTTP GET requests to the OpenWeatherMap API. It facilitates communication with external servers, enabling 
   the application to fetch weather data.
* The json library is utilized to parse the JSON response received from the OpenWeatherMap API. It enables the extraction and manipulation of weather 
   data retrieved from the API.
* The project integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve real-time weather data for specified city names. The API 
   provides weather-related information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, sunrise, sunset, and more.
* The project includes a function, time_format_for_location(utc), which converts UTC timestamps from the API into local time.
* The retrieved weather data is displayed in a text widget within the GUI. Users can view information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, 
   pressure, sunrise, sunset, cloudiness, and a weather description.

[Interactive Maths Quiz](https://github.com/NandhanGPillai/Interactive-Maths-Quiz)
---
* Motivation: Developed this Python-based educational application designed to help users, especially children, enhance their mathematical problem- 
   solving skills in a fun and engaging manner. The application generates random math problems for users to solve, measures their response times, and 
   provides immediate feedback on their answers.
* Random Module used is utilized to generate random operands and operators for math problems.
* Time Module is Used to measure the time taken to solve each problem and calculate the total time.
* Eval Function employed to evaluate user-generated math expressions and determine the correctness of answers.
