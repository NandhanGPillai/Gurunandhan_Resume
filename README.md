## Projects

[Develop an Ovulation predictor Calculator using Python ](https://github.com/NandhanGPillai/Ovulation-Day-Prediction) 
---

1. Created using Visual Studio Code for Python
2. Motivation: Embarked on this project with the noble intention of aiding individuals who have encountered challenges in identifying their ovulation 
   day and simplifying their life planning.
3. Utilized DateTime Module for date parsing and manipulation.
4. Error Handling is implemented to ensure valid user inputs and provide informative error messages.
5. The calculator prompts users to input the first date of their last menstrual period and the length of their menstrual cycle in days.
6. Data validation method validates the provided date format and Data Calculation method estimates the Ovulation day.

[Hey Gurunandhan! What's the weather?](https://github.com/NandhanGPillai/Weather-App)
---

This Weather App is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) application that allows users to retrieve and display real-time weather information for a specified city. The project aims to provide a convenient way for users to access weather data, including temperature, wind speed, pressure, humidity, sunrise, sunset, cloudiness, and a weather description, for a city of their choice.
1. The tkinter library is used to create the graphical user interface (GUI) for the application.
2. The requests library is employed to make HTTP GET requests to the OpenWeatherMap API. It facilitates communication with external servers, enabling 
   the application to fetch weather data.
3. The json library is utilized to parse the JSON response received from the OpenWeatherMap API. It enables the extraction and manipulation of weather 
   data retrieved from the API.
4. The project integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve real-time weather data for specified city names. The API 
   provides weather-related information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, sunrise, sunset, and more.
5. The project includes a function, time_format_for_location(utc), which converts UTC timestamps from the API into local time.
6. The retrieved weather data is displayed in a text widget within the GUI. Users can view information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, 
   pressure, sunrise, sunset, cloudiness, and a weather description.

[Interactive Maths Quiz](https://github.com/NandhanGPillai/Interactive-Maths-Quiz)
---
1. Motivation: Developed this Python-based educational application designed to help users, especially children, enhance their mathematical problem- 
   solving skills in a fun and engaging manner. The application generates random math problems for users to solve, measures their response times, and 
   provides immediate feedback on their answers.
2. Random Module used is utilized to generate random operands and operators for math problems.
3. Time Module is Used to measure the time taken to solve each problem and calculate the total time.
4. Eval Function employed to evaluate user-generated math expressions and determine the correctness of answers.
